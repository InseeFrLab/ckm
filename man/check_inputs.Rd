\title{Check and Preprocess Input Vectors for Utility Measurement}
\usage{
check_inputs(o, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{o}{Numeric vector. The original data vector.}

\item{p}{Numeric vector. The perturbed data vector.}
}
\value{
A concatenated numeric vector containing the filtered original and perturbed values.
        The first half corresponds to the filtered original values, and the second half to the
        corresponding perturbed values.
}
\description{
This function validates and preprocesses two numeric vectors, typically representing
original and perturbed data, to ensure they are suitable for utility measurement calculations.
It performs several checks: equal length, non-zero sums, non-negativity, and absence of NA values.
It then filters out elements where the original vector is zero to avoid division by zero in subsequent
calculations (e.g., Hellinger distance), and ensures the resulting vectors are not empty.
}
\details{
The function stops with an error if:
\itemize{
  \item The vectors have different lengths.
  \item Either vector sums to zero.
  \item Either vector contains negative values.
  \item Either vector contains NA values.
  \item After filtering, either vector is empty.
}
}
\examples{
o <- c(1, 2, 0, 4)
p <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
check_inputs(o, p)
